# Briefing

Creating my first Svelte application by following James Q Quick's todo list tutorial. This should cover Svelte, Sveltekit, Supabase and will result in a todo list app that allows for users to log in and access their stored tasks.

# Tweaks

-   Using `pnpm` instead of `npm`.

# Version change observations

`__layout.svelte` is now `+layout.svelte`.

# Todos

-   [] Add local storage or database with authentication.
-   [] Investigate (and ideally fix) Typescript errors in Svelte and JS files.
-   [] Study TailwindCSS basics and how to organize messy classes.
