# Briefing

Creating my first Svelte application by following James Q Quick's todo list tutorial. This should cover Svelte, Sveltekit, Supabase and will result in a todo list app that allows for users to log in and access their stored tasks.

# Tweaks

- Using `pnpm` instead of `npm`.

# Version change observations

`__layout.svelte` is now `+layout.svelte`.
